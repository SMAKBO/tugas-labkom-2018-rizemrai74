<h1 class="display-3" style="border-bottom: groove;">The History of Testosterone</h1>
<p class="lead">
<pre><h2>A Cowardly Act in Bank Lick, Kentucky</h2></pre>

<p>Dr. Henry Reseding had been looking for a victim for quite some time. Believing he had found the perfect person to experiment on, he plunged the syringe into the old man's arm and walked away. As a coward, Reseding would only prey upon those who had no ability to advocate for their own health. After all, if he really had the elixir of life in his hands, the old man would start to show signs of increased strength. And if the whole thing was a scam, well ... at least he had not hurt himself in this whole endeavor.

Writhing in agony, the old man died a few days later. Infection seeped from the injection site and into his blood, slowly poisoning each of his body organs. His family and friends were infuriated - a white doctor had used an elderly African American man as a guinea pig, and murdered him.

The community of Bank Lick, Kentucky was enraged and sought justice on the cruel doctor. Henry Reseding prepared to flee the country, but disappeared a few days later and was never seen again. His fate has never been confirmed, but it is assumed he met justice when the population of Bank Lick found him. (Source: Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XVI, Issue 5581, September 28, 1889, Page 2.)
Dr. Brown Sequard was a famous physician and a professor at Harvard. Famous for performing experiments on his own body, the doctor discovered testosterone, which was dubbed the "Elixir of Life" by colleagues.</p>

<pre><h2>The Discovery of the "Elixir of Life"</h2></pre>

<p>A short time before Reseding's cowardly act of victimizing the innocent in the name of "research," Dr. Brown Sequard was busy experimenting on himself.

Interested in what caused a digestive problem known as "rumination", he swallowed a sponge on a string. This digestive fluids and stomach contents.

Dr. Sequard's great discovery, however, came from a hypothesis formed on his observation of eunuchs:

    '' There is no need of describing at length of the great effects produced by the castration, when it is made before the adult age. It is particularly well known that eunuchs are characterized by their general debility and their lack of intellectual and physical activity. " 

Sequard also believed that the release of "spermatic fluid" led to a general decline in physical and mental abilities. Sequard correlated strength and vitality to this fluid, and guessed that the loss of vitality in old age must be due to loss of some mysterious material created in the testicles of men.

Since Sequard used his own body for research, he took a mortar and pestle and tried to extract various fluids from the testicles of dogs and guinea pigs. At the age of seventy two, he was beginning to feel the effects of old age. After proving the effect of this elixir on elderly rabbits and dogs, Sequard prepared to experiment on himself:

    "First, blood of the testicular veins; secondly, semen; and thirdly, juice extracted from a testicle, crushed immediately after it has been taken from a dog or a guinea-pig. " 

Throughout the months of May and June in 1889, Sequard gave himself ten injections of this elixir. While Dr. Sequard's health is quite an inexperienced of his age, he has extreme exhaustion upon ending his day's work, and suffered from rumination and muscular rheumatism, a common type of muscular pain and weakness in the elderly.

Almost immediately after starting the injections. Sequard felt an increase in strength and endurance. He was able to work on his feet for hours at a time, and was no longer exhausted after arduous work. He could literally run up the stairs to his lab, and objective testing shows that his arm strength has increased by an astonishing degree.</p>

<pre><h2>Early Experiments with the Elixir of Life</h2></pre>

<p>The scientific world quickly took note of this seemingly miraculous discovery , and dubbed it the "elixir of life." Experiments were started all over the world, in the hopes of confirming and replicating the amazing chemistry.

All over the world, doctors took syringes in hand and injected the supposed "elixir of life" into various patients. Not all "research participants" were informed of the experiment conducted, as in the case of Reseding's victim in Bank Lick.

In San Francisco, an appeal for volunteers was made for a public test of the elixir. The director of the testing program is selected a likeable, seventy year old man named James Gamble. Using an elixir made from a lamb's testicles, Gamble was injected with the fluid, exclaiming,

    "Why, that does not hurt at all! Just a prick of the needle and a little tingling is all! " 

After a few days, Gamble reported that he was more limber, had better digestion, and felt more vigorous than he had in years. Objective tests show improvement in grip strength.

Once news of the successful experiment was leaked, local livestock dealers in San Francisco could not keep guinea pigs in stock. Local doctors are buying the animals in record numbers to perform what is known as the "Brown Sequard Operation."</p>

<pre><h2>Skepticism over the Elixir of Life</h2></pre>

<p>In Kansas City, two doctors are experimenting with the Brown Sequard elixir at a home for the aged. The doctors noted that a combination of brandy, cocaine, and opium would have the same effect.

Doctors around the nation reported a positive response to the elixir were "mental excitement." The experiments of the mid 1800s eventually stalled, and the use of Sequard's elixir began to die out.</p>

<pre><h2>Reviving the Experiment: The Elixir Gets a Name</h2></pre>

<p>It was not until the 20 th century that the chemical causing vitality was revived. The stockyards of Chicago provided an enormous amount of animal material for experimentation, and Fred Koch at the University of Chicago put the animals to use. Koch obtained 40 pounds of bull testicles, and managed to extract 20mg of a pure substance from the material.

Koch Views capons - roosters castrated at a young age - and injected them with the material. Capons never develop the ability to crow or other secondary sexual characteristics, so they are an excellent choice for Koch's experiment on virility. After injecting the capons with the extract, cock-a-doodle-doo's were heard all over the laboratory. Koch's experiment was a success.

The chemical was dubbed testosterone, and scientists were excited by the possibilities. Dr. Brown Sequard was simply ahead of his time - the supposed "elixir of life" was real, and while the hormone could not truly reverse the hands of time, it could endow extra strength and endurance.

In the 1930s, the world was engaged in full-scale research on the hormone, now known to be a steroid. In 1935, the first attempts to synthesize testosterone from cholesterol were made. By 1939, the Nobel Prize was issued to Butenandt and Ruzicka for the discovery of how to synthesize testosterone from cholesterol - this ushered in the Golden Age of steroid chemistry, which lasted through the 1950s.</p>

The Use of Testosterone in the Clinical Setting

Once testosterone was isolated in its pure form, it was put into clinical use almost immediately. Regulatory agencies did not control or monitor the use of drugs in the same way they do today, and testosterone injections were given to those who had hypogonadism (underdeveloped testes).

By the 1950s, scientists were able to formulate the effect of the steroid to be anabolic or erythropoetic (to stimulate red blood cell growth) hypogonadism, but is used for increasing strength or to increase the rate of production for red blood cells. At this point in time, testosterone had to be given through injection or by subcutaneous pellet, as the hormone was not effective if taken orally.

In 1958, scientists began to inject testosterone into ill patients, to help them gain weight.

In the 1970s, a versoin of testosterone called undecanoate was developed. Undecanoate could be taken orally, ushering in a new age of testosterone treatment.

Finally, in the 1990s, a transdermal patch form of testosterone was developed to treat hypogonadism, and in 2000s, a transdermal gel into the standard delivery system (in the United States).

Only a small proportion of the population has hypogonadism, but testosterone has found other uses for it with low levels of testosterone (also called "low-t").</p>

<pre><h2>Abuses of Testosterone</h2></pre>

<p>In Nazi Germany, it is widely believed that anabolic steroids (derived from testosterone) were administered to German soldiers to increase aggressiveness. Adolf Hitler administered injections of testosterone to himself.

The Soviet Union noted the advanced physical strength, aggression, and endurance gained by the German army via the use of steroids, and began experimenting with the steroids in the 1950s. It is quite possible the Soviets used anabolic steroids during the 1952 Olympic Games.

The introduction of anabolic steroids into the United States is attributed to the physician of the US weightlifting team, who saw the effects on the Soviet performance at a competition in Vienna. Dr. John Ziegler was impressed with the rise in strength of US weight lifters. Shortly after this period of time, the anabolic steroid Dianbol was introduced - strengthened testosterone, with fewer side effects.

The Olympic Games held in Melbourne, Australia in 1958 were filled with weight lifters using anabolic steroids. The German Democratic Republic is consistently won in their country, due to a program to synthesize new steroids for their athletes.

In 1967, a ban on the use of anabolic steroids was announced by the International Olympic Council. By the 1970s, most major national sports follow suit and implemented a steroids to improve athletic performance.

To enforce the ban, a test had to be developed - the "epitestosterone test" was first utilized by the Olympic Council in the 1982 games. If an athlete's testosterone level was more than six times greater than their epitestosterone level, then they were using an anabolic steroid to improve performance.

So start a cat-and-mouse game of steroids development and how to detect their presence in an athlete's body. Anabolic steroids that could be excited from the body quickly developed, rendering the epitestosterone test obsolete. As new steroids are developed, new tests must be developed to detect a presence in the body. In 2003, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency discovered a new anabolic steroid (tetrahydrogestrinone, or THG) in wide use among athletes. A new test was developed, and athletes were warned that a positive result of them performing in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.</p>
